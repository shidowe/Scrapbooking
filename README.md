# Patchwork
## How to run the project
## Topic overview

**Scrapbooking**
Personalizable shareable artifact
A mistake on the website is less dramatic than a mistake with real (wasted) material
Get inspired, a sense of community

**Users**
Guest : can only see pages
User : can see, like and create pages
Admin : can do everything a user can + delete pages

**Why a web application ?**

## General architecture

## Functionalities
Creating a page and editing an existing one
Adding text to it (changing its content, position or color)
Changing the name of the page
